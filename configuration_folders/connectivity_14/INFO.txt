Through the folder 'connectivity_14' you will be able to simulate the brain model composed of 14 regions, described in the paper "FNS: an event-driven spiking neural network framework for efficient simulations of large-scale brain models" (2018).

In order to obtain the .CSV of the model activity in the folder experiments/connectivity_14, you can use the following "experiment command":
.\start.bat .\configuration_folders\connectivity_14\configuration_file.xml .\configuration_folders\connectivity_14\interconnectivity_set connectivity_14 16383

Note that 16383 represents the mask to obtain as output the activity of all 14 nodes 

Please read the user manual for additional info
